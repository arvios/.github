# EventZoom

**Open-source visual tool for event-driven architectures — Design, document, and debug events for zoomable clarity.**

EventZoom helps engineering teams visually model, document, and understand their event-driven systems across all layers — from abstract architecture to runtime behavior.

## 🔍 What is EventZoom?

EventZoom is a modular, extensible tool that brings visual clarity to distributed and asynchronous systems.  
It enables:

- 📐 **Design** _(coming soon)_: Map your architecture using layered abstractions (C4, DDD, etc).
- 🧾 **Documentation** _(under development)_: Connect architecture elements to specifications like AsyncAPI and OpenAPI.
- 👀 **Debug** _(coming soon)_: Inspect runtime behavior, track event lifecycles, and detect failure points.

## 🧱 Why EventZoom?

Modern software is increasingly event-driven — but understanding, evolving, and debugging such systems is hard.

EventZoom helps by acting as:

- A **design board** for visualizing systems and flows.
- A **source of truth** that evolves with your system.
- A **bridge** between architecture, development, and operations.

## 📦 Status

> EventZoom is in early development.  
> Initial focus is on the **design and documentation** layer.  
> Simulation and observability features are planned next.
